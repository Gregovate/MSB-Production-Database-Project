```

### Props only (all previews, no DMX/None)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM preview_wiring_map_v6_props;
```

### Master props for a specific preview (includes DeviceType='None')
```sql
SELECT *
FROM preview_wiring_map_v6
WHERE Source = 'PROP' AND PreviewName = :preview_name;
```

### Count of props per preview
```sql
SELECT PreviewName, COUNT(*) AS PropCount
FROM preview_wiring_map_v6_props
GROUP BY PreviewName
ORDER BY PreviewName COLLATE NOCASE;
```

### QA check for wiring issues
```sql
SELECT Issue, PreviewName, Display_Name, Network, Controller, StartChannel, EndChannel
FROM breaking_check_v6
ORDER BY Issue, PreviewName, Network, Controller, StartChannel;
```

### Inspect wiring view (sorted, all sources)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM preview_wiring_sorted_v6
LIMIT 50;
```
